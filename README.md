# iklem-screeps-client

###### Current version 0.1.0

## Disclaimer
There's no visual client for now. My goal is to add one with the help of the community.  
My goal was also make a client to use with multiple server instead of having one to connect (like the steam one) and even the main one.  
This client is usable only on Linux.
